# Future Analog System Technologies Lab at UW

## Mission

Our research covers a broad range of topics related to analog, mixed-signal, RF and mm-wave circuits. The emphasis of our work is novel architectures and circuits which overcome the challenges presented by future low-cost, silicon technologies, such as ultra-low voltage, low-intrinsic device gain, and poor matching characteristic, to name a few.

Our past work includes integrated circuits for wireless communication systems requiring aggressive performance.

A major emphasis of our future research will be to explore architectures and circuits for highly integrated, concurrently operating, heterogeneous-wireless systems which overcome the evolving challenges associated with co-existence. Other areas of research in which we have an interest are mm-wave circuits for 60GHz and imaging applications, low-voltage highly-efficient transmitter systems, ultra-low power RF for cellular based sensor networks, high-speed I/O for chip-to-chip and core-to-memory applications and finally, integrated circuits for bio-medical applications.
